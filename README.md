# CDC_Flight-CO2-Emission-by-Country
Carolina Data Challenge: TOP 5 countries that have the highest average yearly CO2 emissions of passenger flights.

## Inspiration
This yearâ€™s theme is **"Travel"**, and with flights being one of the most efficient ways to travel, they are often the preferred choice. However, the aviation industry is a significant contributor to CO2 emissions, making frequent plane travel a major environmental concern. This project aims to explore which countries have the highest rates of plane travel and how this correlates with geographic factors.

## What it Does
The project visualizes the **average yearly CO2 emissions** from passenger planes, making it easier to compare countries by displaying the data on a global map for clear reference.

## How We Built It
We utilized **R** for data cleaning and **Tableau** for visualizing the data. The visualizations include both a bar chart and a global map to provide comparative insights into each country's plane travel emissions.

## Challenges we ran into
As beginners in R and data cleaning, we found the unfamiliar syntax challenging. Additionally, due to time constraints, we were unable to gather more datasets to offer a more comprehensive analysis of our research question.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We completed our first data-cleaning project and have lots of data visualization and informative graphs!

## What we learned
We learned that how people's choice of transportation during travel also has a huge environmental impact.
Additionally, we learned how to develop a data science question, find the appropriate data, and clean the data to arrive at our final conclusion.
Finally, we learned how to utilize different websites or Apps. Exploring new Apps, for example, Tableau is interesting, because we need to know their purpose and play around with every button they have, and finally find how they are going to help us to achieve our analytic goals.

## What's next for CO2 Emission
Moving forward, we plan to incorporate additional datasets to enhance our research, such as data on travel preferences and domestic tourism spending, to provide more nuanced insights into the environmental impact of travel
