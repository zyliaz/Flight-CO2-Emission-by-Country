# CDC_Flight-CO2-Emission-by-Country
Carolina Data Challenge 2024: TOP 5 countries that have the highest average yearly CO2 emissions of passenger flights.

## Inspiration
This yearâ€™s theme is **"Travel"**, and with flights being one of the most efficient ways to travel, they are often the preferred choice. However, the aviation industry is a significant contributor to CO2 emissions, making frequent plane travel a major environmental concern. This project aims to explore which countries have the highest rates of plane travel and how this correlates with geographic factors.

## What it Does
The project visualizes the **average yearly CO2 emissions** from passenger planes, making it easier to compare countries by displaying the data on a global map for clear reference.

## How We Built It
We used **R** for data cleaning and **Tableau** for data visualization. The visualizations include a bar chart, a bubble graph, and two global maps to provide comparative insights into each country's plane travel emissions.

## Challenges we ran into
As beginners in R and data cleaning, we found the unfamiliar syntax challenging. In addition, due to time constraints, we were unable to find more datasets to collectively offer a more comprehensive analysis of our research question. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We completed our first project using R language and have lots of data visualization and informative graphs!

## What we learned
We learned what countries and why these countries have the highest carbon emissions for domestic passenger flights. 
Additionally, we learned how to develop a research question from a given dataset, target the useful data points, and manipulate and visualize the data to arrive at our final conclusion.
Finally, we learned how to utilize different websites and Apps, as well as using new programming languages and exploring new softwares. This is my first time doing a project with R and Tableau. Being able to apply what I've learned to a project really healped me develop my R programming skills. Tableau is also a relatively new software that I was able to play around and get familiarized with. 

## What's next for CO2 Emission
Moving forward, we plan to incorporate additional datasets to enhance our research, such as data on travel preferences and domestic tourism spending, to provide more nuanced insights into the environmental impact of travel.
